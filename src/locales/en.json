  "data_story": "My over a decade-long career as a professional musician and guitar instructor, aligned with my education, was profoundly shaken by the pandemic. Additionally, the birth of my son served as a catalyst for a career change, allowing me to spend more time with him. I initially decided to acquire new skills independently and later, under the guidance of a mentor, to become a frontend developer. Now, with Kazik attending preschool, I am ready for new challenges, and my desires to engage in creative tasks and meet new people are more unfulfilled than ever before.",
